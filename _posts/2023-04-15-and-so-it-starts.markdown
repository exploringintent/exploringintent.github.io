Life is an unpredictable journey that picks up speed as we navigate through it. One moment, we may be lost in the daily grind of work and responsibilities, and the next, we may find ourselves on a completely different path, exploring and experiencing new responsibilities, hobbies, and interests. It is part of the ebb and flow of life, and it’s important to embrace the changes and opportunities that come our way.

The first “technology blogger” that I was introduced to – Scott Hanselman is responsible for the quote, [“There are a finite number of keystrokes left in your hands before you die.”](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes) This statement that I first encountered around the time I just started to climb my career ladders, but it stuck with me as a powerful reminder about the limited nature of our lives and in a way challenged my perspective to think about how my actions can have a broader impact. First through training materials and presentations, later in technical design documents, sales decks and whiteboard sketches and plans and strategies for uncertain futures. I’m a problem solver by calling and a technical architect by trade. For me, photography, travel, and software development have always been passions that I’ve pursued in my free time that’s an ever-shrinking resource. However, as my life has moved away from writing code daily and towards building relationships and plans, I’ve found myself drawn back to these hobbies. They provide a sense of creative fulfillment and allow me to capture the beauty of the world around me and through that – make sense of things through stories.

Through this personal blog I hope to explore my itch and curiosity for photography, travel, software development, other hobbies and the most random of observations, while sharing my experiences with others who may be on a similar journey. Life is an adventure, and I’m excited to see where this path leads.
